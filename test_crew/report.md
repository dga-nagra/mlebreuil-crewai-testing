### Detailed Report: IPsec Tunnel Establishment Failure Between Zurich (85.184.252.26) and Madrid (46.24.40.133)

#### Overview of Findings:

The analysis of log files and packet captures reveals several issues preventing the establishment of an IPsec tunnel between the routers in Zurich and Madrid. The following findings are identified as primary causes for this failure.

1. **Exceeded Retransmission Limits**:
   - The session with ID 444544 exited due to exceeding retransmission limits (`EV_RE_XMT_EXCEED`). This indicates that packets sent from the Zurich router could not be acknowledged by the Madrid router, suggesting issues such as network congestion, packet loss, or incorrect NAT configuration.

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Sessions (IDs 444545 and 444549) are still waiting for authentication responses (`I_WAIT_AUTH`). This implies that there might be a mismatch in the authentication credentials between the two routers. The most likely cause is an incorrect pre-shared key or certificate configuration.

3. **DMVPN Router Behind Firewall/NAT**:
   - Madrid’s DMVPN router (public IP 46.24.40.133) is behind a firewall performing NAT with private IP 172.30.165.250. The misconfiguration of the firewall could be preventing IKEv2 traffic on port UDP 500 from reaching the DMVPN router, thus blocking tunnel establishment.

4. **IKEv2 Configuration Mismatch**:
   - Multiple attempts to establish an IKEv2 session failed due to potential mismatches in configuration parameters such as encryption algorithms, hash functions, Diffie-Hellman groups, and key lifetimes between the routers.

5. **Network Connectivity Issues Between Peers**:
   - Retransmission issues suggest possible route unreachability or network congestion problems between the two routers.

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **Verify Authentication Credentials**:
   - Ensure that both routers are configured with identical pre-shared keys or certificates for authentication.
   - Check and update configuration files if necessary to match the credentials on both sides.

2. **NAT Configuration Adjustment**:
   - Configure the Madrid firewall to allow IKEv2 traffic (UDP 500) from Zurich’s public IP address.
   - Ensure correct NAT traversal settings are applied, such as enabling UDP encapsulation (ESP over UDP for port 4500).

3. **IKEv2 Configuration Consistency**:
   - Review and synchronize the IKEv2 configuration parameters between the routers to ensure compatibility in encryption algorithms, hash functions, Diffie-Hellman groups, and key lifetimes.
   - Update configurations if necessary based on best practices for secure tunnel establishment.

4. **Network Route Verification**:
   - Perform traceroute or ping tests from Zurich to Madrid’s public IP address (46.24.40.133) to verify network reachability.
   - Investigate any congestion points and ensure there are no blackholes or filtering rules that could block traffic.

5. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
   - Use packet captures and log analysis tools post-implementation to monitor for further issues, particularly focusing on retransmission counts and authentication messages.

By addressing these specific areas with the outlined steps, it is expected that the IPsec tunnel between Zurich (85.184.252.26) and Madrid (46.24.40.133) will be successfully established and maintained.
