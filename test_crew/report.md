### Detailed Report on IPSec Tunnel Establishment Failure Between Zurich and Madrid Routers

#### Summary
The IPSec tunnel establishment between the Zurich router (IP: 85.184.252.26) and the Madrid router (Public IP: 46.24.40.133, Private IP: 172.30.165.250) has failed due to several issues primarily related to NAT configuration and authorization states. The Madrid DMVPN router is located behind a firewall performing NAT, complicating the negotiation process. The following points outline the key findings from the logs and the proposed remediation steps.

#### Findings

1. **Event: EV_NO_EVENT / WAIT_AUTH**
   - **Description**: The sessions are stalled in the WAIT_AUTH state, indicating a blockage in the authorization process.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:54.881 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 9):SM Trace-> SA: I_SPI=112AD55D6FE6B89B R_SPI=4890461ECAA32FE3 (I) MsgID = 1 CurState: I_WAIT_AUTH Event: EV_NO_EVENT
     ```

2. **NAT Detection Issues**
   - **Description**: The log messages clearly show discrepancies in local and remote addresses due to NAT configurations. The Madrid router is located behind a NAT device, causing mismatches that hinder successful negotiations.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:56.461 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):Processing nat detect dst notify
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:56.461 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):Local address not matched
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:56.461 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):Host is located NAT inside
     ```

3. **RE_XMT (Retransmission) Events**
   - **Description**: There were multiple retransmissions logged without successful authentication, suggesting that responses from the Madrid router are likely being blocked or not reaching the Zurich router.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:58.428 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):SM Trace-> SA: I_SPI=C571EF343834DF4F R_SPI=BB515F3AD24E6123 (I) MsgID = 1 CurState: I_WAIT_AUTH Event: EV_RE_XMT
     ```

4. **Failure Events**
   - **Description**: The sessions exceeded the number of allowed retransmissions, leading to failure events due to timeouts, indicating that the tunnel negotiation could not complete.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:59.553 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444544,SA ID = 1):SM Trace-> SA: I_SPI=7B13CAD468D71308 R_SPI=45423664B616691C (I) MsgID = 1 CurState: AUTH_DONE Event: EV_FAIL
     ```

#### Proposed Remediation Steps

1. **NAT Configuration**
   - Enable NAT traversal (NAT-T) on both routers to ensure that IPSec packets can pass through NAT devices. This would involve configuring the proper ISAKMP settings to allow NAT-T and ensuring that the firewall allows UDP port 500 (for IKE) and UDP port 4500 (for NAT-T).

2. **Adjust Firewall Settings**
   - Review and modify the firewall rules at the Madrid site to ensure it permits IPSec traffic, including allowing for the appropriate protocols and ports as specified above.

3. **Update ISAKMP Configuration**
   - Confirm the appropriate ISAKMP settings on both routers. Ensure that the pre-shared keys, encryption methods, and lifetimes are configured correctly to allow for strong and effective negotiation between the peers.

4. **Monitor Connectivity**
   - Utilize extended logging and debugging on both routers to capture detailed information during the tunnel setup process. This logging can help identify any further issues that may arise during subsequent attempts to establish the IPSec tunnel.

5. **Test Establishment After Adjustments**
   - Make the necessary configuration changes and then perform tests to establish the IPSec tunnel, monitoring the logs for successful negotiation.

By implementing these remediation steps, we should be able to resolve the issues causing the IPSec tunnel establishment failure between the Zurich and Madrid routers.

### Recommendations
- Continuous monitoring of the tunnel once established. Ensure periodic testing and validation of the tunnelâ€™s functionality, especially after any network changes.

This structured approach will facilitate the successful establishment of the IPSec tunnel while maintaining security and efficiency across the network.
