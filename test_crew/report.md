### Detailed Report: IPsec Tunnel Establishment Failure Between Zurich (85.184.252.26) and Madrid (46.24.40.133)

#### Overview of Findings:

The analysis of log files and packet captures reveals several issues preventing the establishment of an IPsec tunnel between the routers in Zurich and Madrid. The following findings are identified as primary causes for this failure.

1. **Exceeded Retransmission Limits**:
   - The session with ID 444544 exited due to exceeding retransmission limits (`EV_RE_XMT_EXCEED`). This indicates that packets sent from the Zurich router could not be acknowledged by the Madrid router, suggesting issues such as network congestion, packet loss, or incorrect NAT configuration.

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Sessions (IDs 444545 and 444549) are still waiting for authentication responses (`I_WAIT_AUTH`). This implies that there might be a mismatch in the authentication credentials between the two routers. The most likely cause is an incorrect pre-shared key or certificate configuration.

3. **DMVPN Router Behind Firewall/NAT**:
   - Madrid’s DMVPN router (public IP 46.24.40.133) is behind a firewall performing NAT with private IP 172.30.165.250. The misconfiguration of the firewall could be preventing IKEv2 traffic on port UDP 500 from reaching the DMVPN router, thus blocking tunnel establishment.

4. **IKEv2 Configuration Mismatch**:
   - Multiple attempts to establish an IKEv2 session failed due to potential mismatches in configuration parameters such as encryption algorithms, hash functions, Diffie-Hellman groups, and key lifetimes between the routers.

5. **Network Connectivity Issues Between Peers**:
   - Retransmission issues suggest possible route unreachability or network congestion problems between the two routers.

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **Verify Authentication Credentials**:
   - Ensure that both routers are configured with identical pre-shared keys or certificates for authentication.
   - Check and update configuration files if necessary to match the credentials on both sides.

2. **NAT Configuration Adjustment**:
   - Configure the Madrid firewall to allow IKEv2 traffic (UDP 500) from Zurich’s public IP address.
   - Ensure correct NAT traversal settings are applied, such as enabling UDP encapsulation (ESP over UDP for port 4500).

3. **IKEv2 Configuration Consistency**:
   - Review and synchronize the IKEv2 configuration parameters between the routers to ensure compatibility in encryption algorithms, hash functions, Diffie-Hellman groups, and key lifetimes.
   - Update configurations if necessary based on best practices for secure tunnel establishment.

4. **Network Route Verification**:
   - Perform traceroute or ping tests from Zurich to Madrid’s public IP address (46.24.40.133) to verify network reachability.
   - Investigate any congestion points and ensure there are no blackholes or filtering rules that could block traffic.

5. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
   - Use packet captures and log analysis tools post-implementation to monitor for further issues, particularly focusing on retransmission counts and authentication messages.

By addressing these specific areas with the outlined steps, it is expected that the IPsec tunnel between Zurich (85.184.252.26) and Madrid (46.24.40.133) will be successfully established and maintained.

### Detailed Report on IPSec Tunnel Establishment Failure Between Zurich and Madrid Routers

#### Summary
The IPSec tunnel establishment between the Zurich router (IP: 85.184.252.26) and the Madrid router (Public IP: 46.24.40.133, Private IP: 172.30.165.250) has failed due to several issues primarily related to NAT configuration and authorization states. The Madrid DMVPN router is located behind a firewall performing NAT, complicating the negotiation process. The following points outline the key findings from the logs and the proposed remediation steps.

#### Findings

1. **Event: EV_NO_EVENT / WAIT_AUTH**
   - **Description**: The sessions are stalled in the WAIT_AUTH state, indicating a blockage in the authorization process.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:54.881 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 9):SM Trace-> SA: I_SPI=112AD55D6FE6B89B R_SPI=4890461ECAA32FE3 (I) MsgID = 1 CurState: I_WAIT_AUTH Event: EV_NO_EVENT
     ```

2. **NAT Detection Issues**
   - **Description**: The log messages clearly show discrepancies in local and remote addresses due to NAT configurations. The Madrid router is located behind a NAT device, causing mismatches that hinder successful negotiations.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:56.461 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):Processing nat detect dst notify
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:56.461 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):Local address not matched
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:56.461 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):Host is located NAT inside
     ```

3. **RE_XMT (Retransmission) Events**
   - **Description**: There were multiple retransmissions logged without successful authentication, suggesting that responses from the Madrid router are likely being blocked or not reaching the Zurich router.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:58.428 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444548,SA ID = 4):SM Trace-> SA: I_SPI=C571EF343834DF4F R_SPI=BB515F3AD24E6123 (I) MsgID = 1 CurState: I_WAIT_AUTH Event: EV_RE_XMT
     ```

4. **Failure Events**
   - **Description**: The sessions exceeded the number of allowed retransmissions, leading to failure events due to timeouts, indicating that the tunnel negotiation could not complete.
   - **Example Log**: 
     ```
     Nov 30 2024 11:16:59.553 UTC: IKEv2-INTERNAL:(SESSION ID = 444544,SA ID = 1):SM Trace-> SA: I_SPI=7B13CAD468D71308 R_SPI=45423664B616691C (I) MsgID = 1 CurState: AUTH_DONE Event: EV_FAIL
     ```

#### Proposed Remediation Steps

1. **NAT Configuration**
   - Enable NAT traversal (NAT-T) on both routers to ensure that IPSec packets can pass through NAT devices. This would involve configuring the proper ISAKMP settings to allow NAT-T and ensuring that the firewall allows UDP port 500 (for IKE) and UDP port 4500 (for NAT-T).

2. **Adjust Firewall Settings**
   - Review and modify the firewall rules at the Madrid site to ensure it permits IPSec traffic, including allowing for the appropriate protocols and ports as specified above.

3. **Update ISAKMP Configuration**
   - Confirm the appropriate ISAKMP settings on both routers. Ensure that the pre-shared keys, encryption methods, and lifetimes are configured correctly to allow for strong and effective negotiation between the peers.

4. **Monitor Connectivity**
   - Utilize extended logging and debugging on both routers to capture detailed information during the tunnel setup process. This logging can help identify any further issues that may arise during subsequent attempts to establish the IPSec tunnel.

5. **Test Establishment After Adjustments**
   - Make the necessary configuration changes and then perform tests to establish the IPSec tunnel, monitoring the logs for successful negotiation.

By implementing these remediation steps, we should be able to resolve the issues causing the IPSec tunnel establishment failure between the Zurich and Madrid routers.

### Recommendations
- Continuous monitoring of the tunnel once established. Ensure periodic testing and validation of the tunnel’s functionality, especially after any network changes.

This structured approach will facilitate the successful establishment of the IPSec tunnel while maintaining security and efficiency across the network.
